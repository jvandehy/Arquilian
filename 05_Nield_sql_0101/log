Foreword
	"an accessable and easy-to-read discussion of SQL - a core database technology
Preface
	"This book will give you a practical focus on using SQSL, and will steer you 
	away from unnecessary technical details"

Chapter 1 Why Learn SQL
	"Structured Query Language"
	SQL is a universal language to work with data on database platforms
Chapter 2 Databases
Section What is a DataBase
	"Database" - anything that collects and holds data
	RDBMS - Relational Database Management System
Section Exploring Relational Databases
	Example
		ORDER table refers to CUSTOMER table for customer information
			ORDER Table
				has field called CUSTOMER_ID
			Example:
				ORDER_ID	ORDER_DATE 	SHIP_DATE 	CUSTOMER_ID
				3		2015-04-23	2015-04-23		5
				4		2015-04-18	2015-04-22		4

			CUSTOMER table 
				holds the customer information for each customer id.
			Example:
				CUSTOMER_ID 	NAME		REGION 	  	STREET ADDRESS
				1		Lite Industrial	Southwest	729 Ravine Way
				2		Rex Tooling	Southwest	6129 Collie Blvd
		When we go through the ORDER Table, we can use the CUSTOMER_ID to look up the customer information
		in the CUSTOMER Table

	Relational Database - tables have fields that point to information in other tables
	Normalization 	- seperating the different types of data into their own tables
			(rather than putting them in one table)
		    	- avoids redundancy, "bloating", maintanance issues
Section Why Separate Tables
Section Choosing a Database Solution
	Lightweight Database
		Users - One to a small number
		Overhead - None or little
		Examples of Lightweight Database solutions
			SQLite
			Microsoft Access
	Centralized Database
		Users -  tens, hundreds othousands of users
		Servers - Centralized Databases run on servers
			- client requests, server gives it up!
		Examples - 
			MySQL
				highly recomended, open source, free to use, straightforward to install and set up.
				used by Facebook, Google, eBay, Twittter 
			PostgreSQL
			MariaDB
			Others (Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, IBM DB2)
		You install these solutions onto a computer, and turn that computer into a server
		
	Universal aspects 	
		"the experience betseen different database solutions should be largely the same."
Chapter 3 SQLite
Section What is SQLite
Section SCLiteStudio
	an SQL editor
	install from sqlitestudio.pl
Section Importing and Navigating Databases
	Data Types
		Integer
		Text
		Datetime
		Boolean
		Decimal
Chapter 4 Select (Statement)
Section Retrieving Data with SQL
	Select Statement
		Most Common -  retrieve and display data
		"far more" - transform data; build summaries
		Example: (Select all columns of a table)
			SELECT * FROM CUSTOMER;
			// This runs a query and displays the results
			// SELECT allows you to choose which columns to pull from a table
			// * is a placeholder to specify "all columns"
			// CUSTOMER is the name of the table being queried
		Example: (Select specific columns of a table)
			SELECT CUSTOMER_ID, NAME FROM CUSTOMER
Section Expressions in SELECT Statements
	Calculations
		"Generate a calculated column"
		Example:
			SELECT
			PRODUCT_ID,
			DESCRIPTION,
			PRICE,
			PRICE * 1.07 AS TAXED_PRICE
			FROM PRODUCT;
		Result (partial)
			PRODUCT_ID	DESCRIPTION	PRICE		TAXED_PRICE
			1		Copper		7.51		8.0357
			2		Aluminum	2.58		2.7606
			3		Silver		15		16.05
