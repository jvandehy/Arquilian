This is the log for Todd McCloud's 2017 Course "Learn How to Code Google's Go Programming Language"

Welcome & Course Overview
Variables, Value and Type
	variadic parameters
		signified by ...<some type>
	type interface
		type interface{} is the empty interface
		everything is of type interface
	...interface{} as a parameter means

		1. Using the short declaration operator, Assign these values to Variables
		with the identifiers x and y and z
			a. 42
			b. James Bond
			c. true
		2. Now print the values stored in those variables using
			a. a single print statement
			b. multiple print statements
		3. Solution: see ninga1_1.go
	Hands-on Exercise #2
		1. Use var to declare three variables.
