Section Exploring Relational Databases
	Example
		ORDER table refers to CUSTOMER table for customer information
			ORDER Table
				has field called CUSTOMER_ID
			Example:
				ORDER_ID	ORDER_DATE 	SHIP_DATE 	CUSTOMER_ID
				3		2015-04-23	2015-04-23		5
				4		2015-04-18	2015-04-22		4

			CUSTOMER table 
				holds the customer information for each customer id.
			Example:
				CUSTOMER_ID 	NAME		REGION 	  	STREET ADDRESS
				1		Lite Industrial	Southwest	729 Ravine Way
				2		Rex Tooling	Southwest	6129 Collie Blvd
		When we go through the ORDER Table, we can use the CUSTOMER_ID to look up the customer information
		in the CUSTOMER Table

	Relational Database - tables have fields that point to information in other tables
	Normalization 	- seperating the different types of data into their own tables
			(rather than putting them in one table)
		    	- avoids redundancy, "bloating", maintanance issues
Section Why Separate Tables
Section Choosing a Database Solution
	Lightweight Database
		Users - One to a small number
		Overhead - None or little
		Examples of Lightweight Database solutions
			SQLite
			Microsoft Access
	Centralized Database
