		Graph Alorithm (GPS device)
		Dynamic Programming
	What you will learn about solving problems
		Examples:
		Graph Alogrithms (Video Game)	
			"you can write an AI system that follows the user around using graph algorithms"
		"k-nearest neighbors" (Recommendations)
		NP-complete problems
			"shows you how to identify those problems that come up with an algorithm that
				gives you an approximate answer"
		Know widely applicable algorithms (New Knowledge)
			algorithms for:
