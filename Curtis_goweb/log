	HTTP Requests
		"In many of the examples in this book, the interesting part
		 of what's happening is less about what a browser is displaying
		 and more about the way the browser interacts with a web server."

	    	 We're interested in seeing:
			what data was sent in the request
			what data comes back (response body and the headers				

	Generate Requests
		"You can generate your own requests from the command line by
		 using the curl tool. For example:
			curl -i www.sitepoint.com 
			
			result:

			HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently
			Content-length:0
			Location:https://www.sitpoint.com
 	Go Tools
		gofmt
		goimports will automatically add and remove import lines from your code as required
