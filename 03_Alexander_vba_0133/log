Introduction
	Topics covered
		Visual Basic for Applications ("VBA")
		VBA  is the programming language built into Excel
		This book ..."shows you how to write programs that automate various tasks in Excel"
	What you need to know
	What you need to have
	Conventions in this book
		Excel Commands
			"context sensitive Ribbon menu system"
		Visual Basic Editor Commands
			Visual basic Editor is the window in which you work with your VBA code.
	How this book is organized
Part 1 Introduction to Excel VBA
Chapter 1 Essentials of Spreadsheet Application Development
	What is a Spreadsheet Application
		"spreadsheet file (or group of related files) that is designed so that:
			 someone other than the developer can perform useful work without extensive training"
	A good spreadsheet application
	Steps for Application Development
		Determining User Needs
		Planning an Application that meets user needs
		Determining the Appropriate User Interface
			Customizing the Ribbon
			Customizing Shortcut Menus
			Creating Shortcut keys
			Creating custom dialog boxes
			Using AtiveX controls on a worksheet
				Excel lets you add userform ActiveX controls to
					worksheets "drawing layer"
				Drawing layer is an invisible layer on top of a sheet that holds 
					pictures, charts and other objects.
				Active X controls let the user make choices by operating familiar controls
			Controls come in two types
				Form Controls (Easier to Use)
				Active X Controls (More Flexible)
		Concerning Yourself with the End User
		Testing the Application
		Making the application bulletproof
			Locking Cells / Objects
			Hiding Formulas
			Protecting Workbook
			Passwords
		Making the applicaiton aestetically appealing and intuitive
			Consistancy
			Keep it simple
		User Help System

		Distribution
		Updating
Chapter 2 Introducing Visual Basic for Applications
	Getting a head start with the Macro recorder
		"A macro is essentially VBA code that you can call to execute any number of actions."
		"A recorded macro is technically no different from a VBA procedure you create manually."
	Creating your first macro
		1. Developer Tab -> "Record Macro"
 			// starts the "Macro Recorder" and activates the "Record Macro" dialog box
		2. Enter a single-word name for the macro (for example MyName )
		3. Assign the macro to the shortcut key (for example Ctrl+Shift+N)
		4. Click the OK button
			// closes the "Record Macro" dialog box
			// begins the recording of your actions
		5. Select any cell on your Excel Spreadsheet, and type in something (for Example "Jeff"), then Enter.
		6. Developer tab -> "Stop Recording"
			// this creates a macro in a new module named "Module1" 
	Examining your first macro
		7. Open the Visual Basic Editor Developer -> Visual Basic
		8. Examine the "Project Window" for a list of open workbooks and addins
		8b. (This can be done by View -> "Project Explorer" if the defalut window doesnt appear.
		9. Expand the Window to make Module1 visible.
		10. Double click Module1.
			// the code in the module appears in the "Code Window"
	
	Code of first macro
		Sub MyName()
		'	
		' MyName Macro
		'	
		' Keyboard Shortcut: Ctrl+Shift+N
		'
		' ActiveCell.FormulaR1C1 = "Jeff"
		End Sub

	Testing the Macro
		Return to Excel and Activate a worksheet
		Select a cell and press Ctrl+Shift+N
		Your name should be entered into the cell

	Editing the macro
		insert
			ActiveCell.Font.Bold = True
			// This makes the text bold when the macro is used. 

	Comparing absolute and relative macro recording
	Excel has two modes for recording
		1. Absolute Reference
			Excel's default recording mode is absolute reference
			absolute refence means "it does not automatically adjust when the formula is pasted into a new location"
		2. Relative Reference	
	Macro Example: "Absolute Reference"
		Recording The Macro (this is done using the spreadsheet "Sample.xlsm", but any spreadsheet with text in column D would work)
			Select Cell A1 (Before recording)
			Developer Tab => Record Macro => Record Macro Menu
				Name => "AddTotal"
				Save Location => "This Workbook"
				=> OK
			// at this point Excel is recording your actions
			While Recording
				Select Cell A16; type "Total" in Cell A16
				Select Cell D16 and type "=COUNTA(D2:D15)
				// This gives a  count of the number of cells that have text in them 
			Developer Tab => "Stop Recording"
			// The Sample.xlsm Spreadsheet has the value "14" in Cell D16, as expected.
		Testing the Macro
			By deleting the row 16, we can remove the desired text and formulas from the sheet.
			Then by running the macro;
				Developer Tab => Macros => Macro name "AddTotal" => "Run"
			Result:  The correct label and total in cell D16 appears on line 16'
		Code Examination (Macro "AddTotal")
			Developer Tab => Macros => Macro name "AddTotal" => "Edit"
			// This opens the Visual Basic Editor
				Sub AddTotal()
				  Range("A16").Select
				  ActiveCell.FormulaR1C1 = "Total"
				  Range("D16"). Select
				  ActiveCell.FormulaR1C1 ="=COUNTA(R[-14]C:R{-1}C)"
				End Sub
