 This is the log for Brian Godsey's 2017 book "Think Like a Data Scientist"
About this Book
	Data Science is a new field whose components are "well established"
		Components:
			Statistics
			Software Development
			Evidence Based Problem Solving
			
	Blurry lines between Data Science and other related fields
		Related Fields
			Database Architecture
			Big Data Engineering
			Machine Learning
			High performance Computing

	"Core" of Data Science
		"the interplay between 
			data content, 
			the goals of a given project and 
			the data-analytic methods used"
		"applying the scientific method to data sets in order to acheive progect goals" 
	Management the Core with "any software necessary" where the software 
		and how to implement it are details.	
		"software as a necessary set of tools, like test tubes, flasks and bunson burners" 
		"Focus always returns to the key concepts and challenges that are unique to 
		    each project in data science, and the n process of organizing and harnessing available
		    resources and information to achieve project goals"

Part 1 Philosophies of Data Science

1.0 Overview
	"Data science as a set of processes and concepts that act as a guide for making progress and decisions
	    within a data-centric project"
	"The thought processes of a data scientist can be more important than the specific tools used"
	"Certain concepts pervade nearly all aspects of work in data science"

1.1 Data Science and this Book
	Origins of data science "somewhere between statistics and software development"

	Data Sciences (Three Components)
		Statistics
		Softwarew
		Subject Matter Expertise / Domain Knowledge
			Maybe not such a big deal
			This takes the least of the three to learn well

	Issues in Data Science Projects:
		Data Quality
		Data Volume
