			Command Line Arguments
	Command Line Agruments
		Args	is a variable
			part of the os package	
			its name outside of the os package is os.Args
			os.Args is a slice of strings
			os.Args[0] is always the name of the command itself
	Echo1 Program
		//	Echo1 prints its command-line arguments
		package main

		import (
			"fmt"
			"os"
		)
		func main() {
			var s, sep string
			for i :=1; i<len(os.Args); i++ {
				s += sep + os.Args[i]
				sep =""
			} 
			fmt.Println(s)
		}
		
		// += is an "assigment operator"; it concatenates and assigns back to s
		// loop is of general structure for initialization; condition; post {
		//					zero or more statements
		//					}
		//		here initialization must be a simple statement:
		//								a short variable declaration
		//								an increment
		//								assignment statement
		//								
		//		here condition is boolean
