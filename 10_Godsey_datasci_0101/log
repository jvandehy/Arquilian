 This is the log for Brian Godsey's 2017 book "Think Like a Data Scientist"
About this Book
	Data Science is a new field whose components are "well established"
		Components:
			Statistics
			Software Development
			Evidence Based Problem Solving
			
	Blurry lines between Data Science and other related fields
		Related Fields
			Database Architecture
			Big Data Engineering
			Machine Learning
			High performance Computing

	"Core" of Data Science
		"the interplay between 
			data content, 
			the goals of a given project and 
			the data-analytic methods used"
		"applying the scientific method to data sets in order to acheive progect goals" 
	Management the Core with "any software necessary" where the software 
		and how to implement it are details.	
		"software as a necessary set of tools, like test tubes, flasks and bunson burners" 
		"Focus always returns to the key concepts and challenges that are unique to 
		    each project in data science, and the n process of organizing and harnessing available
		    resources and information to achieve project goals"
	Roadmap

	Lessons Learned

Part 1 Philosophies of Data Science

1.0 Overview
	"Data science as a set of processes and concepts that act as a guide for making progress and decisions
	    within a data-centric project"
	"The thought processes of a data scientist can be more important than the specific tools used"
	"Certain concepts pervade nearly all aspects of work in data science"

1.1 Data Science and this Book
	Origins of data science "somewhere between statistics and software development"

	Data Sciences (Three Components)
		Statistics
		Softwarew
		Subject Matter Expertise / Domain Knowledge
			Maybe not such a big deal
			This takes the least of the three to learn well

	Issues in Data Science Projects:
		Data Quality
		Data Volume
		Processing Speed
		Algorithm Parameters
		Interpretability
		
		"No important aspect goes unnoticed"

1.2 Awareness is Valuable		

	Awareness
		"A data scientist's main responsibility is to try to imagine all of the possibilities, 
		    address the ones that matter, and reevaluate them all as successes and failures happen"
		"That is why ... awareness and familiarity with uncertainty are the most valuable
		    things I can offer as a data scientist."
		"...imagination can be a data scientist's best friend"

1.3 Developer vs Data Scientist

	Software Developer "develop systems of well-defined components"		
	Data Scientist "work with systems where at least one of the components isn't well defined prior 
		to being built" (and that component is usually closely involved with data processing or analysis)
	Probabilistic
		Data scientists specialize in creating systems that rely on probabilistic statements 
		    about data and results.
		Data scientists answer questions that involve data exploration and uncertainty.
		Exploration - necessarily involving statistics - falls squarely in the realm of the data scientist.
