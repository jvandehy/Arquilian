This is the log for Bruce Ferreira's 2014 book "Google Apps Script:Web Applications Development Essentials, 2nd Ed"
Preface
	Google Apps Script "a service which runs from Google Apps, Sites and Documents"
	Uses:
		Automates day-to-day tasks for speadsheets
		Provides a complete application platform
		Can create "entire data driven websites and applications' 
			that "run across most modern browsers".
	Features:
		Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
		Scripts Manager
		Built in DeBugging
		Automatic Code Completion
		Timed Event Triggers
		Automated Revisions
		Web based 
		
	Google Apps Script is the "Swiss Army Knife" behind the main Google Products.
	Apps Script vs App Engine 
		App Engine - requires a place for you to develop and deploy your code
		Apps Script - you build code intoexisting Google platform
	Communication:
		"Apps Script can communicate through:
			JDBC
			JSON
			SOAP
			urlFetch method 
		HTML Service
			"HTML service gives Google Apps Script programmers the ability to build custom
				user interfaces that can run inside a spreadsheet window as a 
				Google gadget or completely independently in a browser"
	Web Applications
		"This book will focus on teaching you how to build powerful web applications using Google Apps Scripts"

	Google Web Toolkit ( a more advanced and complicated supject)
Chapter 1 "First Steps in Google Apps Script"
Section 1 Google Apps Script is...
	"Google Apps Script is
		a coding and application development platform
			built into Google Apps"
	"Google Apps Script allows youto add functionality to
		spreadsheets
		Gmail
		Sites
		other services"
	"Focus on the concept of using Google Apps Script to
		build apps that run from
			a spreadsheet
			a browser window
			within a google site
	User Interfaces in Google Apps Script
		Ways to create user interfaces
			UiApp Service (older) 
			"gadgets" for google sites
			HTML service
		UiApp Service 
			"User Interface	App"
			released in 2010 as a way to allow developers to collect input
			input was then sent to the script for processing
			UiApp uses the Google Web Toolkit (GWT) widget set
			Widgets allow you to create things like 
				text boxes and submit buttons	
				flextables and listboxes
			UiApp will not be receiving updates - USE HTML INSTEAD!
		HTML Service
			HTML, CSS and javascript
Section "What You Will Get From This Book"
	Learn all the necessary elements that go into building web applications with GAS.
Section "Getting Started"
	Google Script Editor Window
		Google Drive => "Create" => "Script"=> Google Script Editor Window				
	Selected Menu Comments
		"File" Submenus 
		    Save/Delete/Rename/New "typical"
		    Manage Versions
			"turn back the clock"
			also allows you to control which version users are accessing
		    Project Properties
			store information for use at script runtime
			also available by using "Properties Service" in the code
		"Edit" Submenu
		    "nothing very exciting"
		"View" Submenu
		    Execution
		    Transcript
			Execution Transcript will list each command as it is run
				the order the code is executed in (for debugging)
		    Logs (used with the "Logger Service")
			Example of using Log:
			    1. Add to Script Editor
				function myFunction(){
		    		Logger.log('A test of the Log');
				}
	    		    2. Click Run
	    		    3. Check the Logs (View => Logs)
				it worked!
		"Run" Submenu
		"Publish" Submenu
		    "Deploy as web app"
			- makes displaying a User Interface possible
			- also the place for distributing on the Google Chrome Web Store.
