About this Book
Chapter 1 Introduction to Algorithms
	Algorithm => An algorithm is a set of instructions for accomplishing a task
	Highlights
		Binary Search
		Graph Alorithm (GPS device)
		Dynamic Programming
	What you will learn about solving problems
		Examples:
		Graph Alogrithms (Video Game)	
			"you can write an AI system that follows the user around using graph algorithms"
		"k-nearest neighbors" (Recommendations)
		NP-complete problems
			"shows you how to identify those problems that come up with an algorithm that
				gives you an approximate answer"
		Know widely applicable algorithms (New Knowledge)
			algorithms for:
				AI
				databases
				bigger challenges
	Binary Search
		senerio: Facebook needs to find username
		"This is a search problem"
		solution: Binary Search
		
		Binary Search is an algorithm
			input - a sorted list of elements
			output - postion where its located
				or null
		Example: Guess a number between 1 and 100 where you are told if too high or too low.
			Technique	Result
			Guess 50 	"Too Low"	// you just eliminated half of the numbers.
			Next Guess 75	"Too High"	// again you eliminate half of the remaining numbers
			Then Guess 63	"Too High"

		Generally with binary search, you eliminate half the possibilities each step
			100=>50=>25=>13=>7=>4=>2=>1  7 steps.
		How many steps max?
			"In General, for any list of n, binary search will take log2 n steps to run the worse case.
